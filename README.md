# MongoDB course

This repository contains an introduction to MongoDB and consists of two parts. First it contains a
presentation, and second it contains a Spring application with exercises for attendees to fulfill.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the demo application, your system need to meet the following requirements:
- Java 17+
- Docker (exercises use Test Containers)
- Your favorite IDE

## Exercises

Two files are central in this training:
- ReservationRepository
- ReservationRepositoryTest

The repository class contains code examples and exercises to complete, where the test class contains integration
tests that validate the implementations. The easiest way is to run these tests in your IDE while you progress
through the exercises.

## Branches

This repository contains two branches:
- main, which contains the exercises without answers
- answers, which contains the exercises with answers

Be aware that by default, building the main branch should fail, as the exercises have not been implemented yet.
